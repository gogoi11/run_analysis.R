# CodeBook for the `tidy_data.txt`

This is the Codebook for the `tidy_data.txt` dataset uploaded in this repository. 
For more information on how this data was obtained see the `README.Rmd` included in this repository as well.

## Data

The `tidy_data.txt` is a txt file with space-separated values. It contains 68 columns/variables and 180 rows. The first row includes the column names.

## Variables
There are 2 categorical variables, `subject` and `activity`, and 66 measurements variables.
The measurement variables were normalised to be between -1 and 1 before any transformations were made. More info in the `README.Rmd` file. No units were provided after normalisation. 
**(Comment: I believe that these values are unit-less because of the normalisation).**

## Transformations
The transformations were applied on the data inside the zip file from `https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip`. For more information on the data source see the `README.md` file.  

The following steps were applied:
1. Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set, `full_data`
2. Extracted only the measurements on the `mean()` and `std()` for each measurement.
3. Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

For details on how the transformations were made see the `README.md` and the `run_analysis.R` file.
